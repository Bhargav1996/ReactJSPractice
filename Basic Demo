Package-lock.json file is also consider dependencey but its lock dependancy like its working this version only.

React create its own DOM its called virtual dom. in this have method createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
ex const root = ReactDOM.createroot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render{
    <!-- <React.StrictMode> -->
    <!-- <App/> -->

}

react-script is a responsible to run index.html file to index.js file.


// Vite 
In this index.html file giving the out side of public and SRc folder.
inside this there is no dependancy in package.json file to run index.htm file to main.js
its directly given script tag in index.html file which is main.jsx


//Hooks 
Throgh hooks UI data will be update in react.
React control UI update
for use hooks we need to import useState

useState is resposible for change state like propogate in UI
Uing use state we are two value. zeroth index will get any variable and second will give function.



// Vitual DOM
Createroot create a DOM like structor and check main DOM and virtual Dom 
class is reserve keyword in jsx so we have to use className.

Props give us Object inside this default property hidden scop[[protptype]]



for use props as a object we need to create on object first and call with declaring variable = object in {}. We can also create array and access the same array in object

Create componenet , how to pass props . passing value in component using props 

// Hooks React give Hooks to copy 

useCallback hook is a react hook that lets you cache a function defination between re-renders
useCallback hooks take two parameter one is function and second is dependancy in array format

useEffect Hokks is  a lets you synchronize a cpmonent with a externl system when page load first useEffect will run
no need to store in variable its also take two parameters one is function second is dependancy in Array format

useRef is a reference use if we want to take referance of anything will use useRef hook
